# Tensorflow - Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs

## Introduction

This directory contains the [_Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs_](https://github.com/igul222/improved_wgan_training) 
benchmark. The repository contains multiple experiments, but this benchmark is 
based on the ResNet model with the [imagenet-small](http://image-net.org/small/download.php) dataset. 

(Python 2.7 only)

## Downloading the Data

From the root of the benchmark, execute the following commands to download the data. 

```
cd dataset
bash download-imagenet-small.sh
```

## Running the Benchmark

From the root of the benckmark, execute the following commands to run the benchmark. 

```
cd scripts
bash benchmark-imagenet-small.sh
```

* You may need to adjust batch size to run on machines with less GPU memory.

## Changes

* Added profiler start and end point.

* Added wall-clock time to output.

* Changed pathing to organize output files better.
